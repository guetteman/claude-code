## Your task

- Follow the `feature/<feature-name>` naming convention for the branch, where `<feature-name>` is a concise, hyphenated description of the feature.
- Turn on plan mode.
- Use the interview skill for answering any questions about the feature you have.
- When you have a first version of the plan, validate it with the laravel architect, pest tdd expert, and laravel security reviewer agents.
- Once validated, create the new branch in the repository.
- Copy the finalized plan into a new file at `specs/<feature-name>.md`.

## Notes
- Make sure the plan is created in phases.
- Each phase should have clear goals and deliverables.
- Implement each phase step by step.
